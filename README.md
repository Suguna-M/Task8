# Task8

Clustering with K-Means

Features:

- Data Visualization: 2D and 3D visualizations of the dataset to understand customer distribution.
- K-Means Clustering: Applies K-Means clustering to identify customer segments.
- Elbow Method: Uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
- Silhouette Score: Evaluates clustering performance using the Silhouette Score

Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

Output:

The project generates various visualizations, including:

- 2D and 3D plots of the dataset.
- K-Means clustering results with different numbers of clusters.
- Silhouette Score plot to determine the optimal number of clusters.
